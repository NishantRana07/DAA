<h2>Bubble Sort By Nishant Rana</h2>
</center>
 <h4><i> Bubble sort is the sorting algorithm that repetedly swap the adjacent elements to sort the array </i><h4>

- It uses 2 loops -> Inner loop (N) and Outer loop (N-1)
- Inner loop goes from 0 to N and helps to repeat the inner loop
- Outer loop goes from 1 to N-1 and repedly swaps adjacent elemets with checking the conditions
